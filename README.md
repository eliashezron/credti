# CREDTI Project

---

## Overview

**CREDTI** is a decentralized lending platform designed to provide **uncollateralized loans** on blockchain networks. By integrating **Reclaim Protocol** and **ZKtls** technology, CREDTI enables users to prove their off-chain financial credibility privately and securely, without exposing sensitive data. Built on multiple EVM-compatible networks (**Celo**, **Base**, **Scroll**, and **Polygon**), CREDTI provides a seamless and scalable solution for bridging Web2 financial systems with Web3 lending mechanisms.

---

## Key Features

- **Uncollateralized Lending**: Users can access loans without providing collateral by proving their creditworthiness via off-chain proofs.
- **Privacy with ZKtls**: Utilizes zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to verify financial information without revealing sensitive details.
- **Multi-Chain Deployment**: Supports multiple chains, including Celo, Base, Scroll, and Polygon.
- **Decentralized Trust**: Smart contracts handle loan issuance, repayment, and fund management trustlessly.
- **Emergency Pause**: A fail-safe mechanism allows pausing the contract during emergencies.

---

## Core Components

1. **Reclaim Protocol**:
   - Integrated to verify zero-knowledge proofs generated by financial institutions or external providers.
   - Verifies users' financial credibility on-chain.

2. **Smart Contract**:
   - Written in Solidity.
   - Handles:
     - Loan issuance.
     - Repayment and interest calculation.
     - Emergency pause functionality.
     - Loan defaults.

3. **Supported Chains**:
   - **Celo**: Environmentally friendly and mobile-first blockchain.
   - **Base**: Scalable Ethereum Layer 2 solution.
   - **Scroll**: zkEVM-based blockchain for high-performance applications.
   - **Polygon**: Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum.

## Technical Specifications

### Smart Contract

- **Programming Language**: Solidity (version `^0.8.20`)
- **Features**:
  - Loan issuance and repayment with interest.
  - Integration with `@reclaimprotocol/verifier-solidity-sdk` for proof validation.
  - Emergency pause to prevent unauthorized activity during critical situations.

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js,  celo copmposer , ethers.js, wagmi,for wallet interaction.
- **Backend**: hardhat for handling proof generation.
- **Blockchain**: Smart contracts deployed on multiple EVM-compatible chains.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: reclaim protocol.

---

## How It Works

1. **Proof Generation**:
   - Users generate a proof of their financial credibility using the Reclaim Protocol.
   - Proofs are securely signed and submitted to the CREDTI smart contract.

2. **Proof Verification**:
   - The smart contract verifies the proof using Reclaim's on-chain verification SDK.

3. **Loan Issuance**:
   - Upon successful verification, the requested loan is transferred to the user's wallet.
   - Loan details (amount, due date, etc.) are stored on-chain.

4. **Repayment**:
   - Users repay the loan plus interest before the due date.
   - Smart contract validates the repayment and marks the loan as repaid.

5. **Loan Default**:
   - If a loan is not repaid by the due date, the loan is marked as defaulted.

## Smart Contract Functions

### User Functions

- `lend_uncollateralized_loans(uint256 loanAmount, uint256 duration, Reclaim.Proof memory proof)`: Requests a loan after verifying proof.
- `repay()`: Allows users to repay their loans with interest.
- `getVaultBalance()`: Returns the available funds in the lending pool.

### Owner-Only Functions

- `fundVault(uint256 amount)`: Funds the vault with USDC tokens.
- `setInterestRate(uint256 _interestRate)`: Updates the annual interest rate.
- `withdraw(uint256 amount)`: Withdraws funds from the lending pool.
- `togglePause()`: Pauses/unpauses the contract in emergencies.
